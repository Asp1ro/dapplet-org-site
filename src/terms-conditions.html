        <p>The website is provided to you "AS IS" and "AS AVAILABLE" and with all faults and defects without warranty of
          any

          whether
          express, implied, statutory or otherwise, with respect to the website, including all implied warranties of

          out of
          course of dealing, course of performance, usage or trade practice. Without limitation to the foregoing,
          Dapplets
          Project provides no warranty or undertaking, and makes no representation of any kind that the website will

          are free of viruses, scripts, trojan horses, worms, malware, timebombs or other harmful components.
        </p>
        <p>Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of or limitations on implied warranties or the limitations on
          the
          applicable statutory rights of a consumer, so some or all of the above exclusions and limitations may not
          apply to
          you.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h2>Limitation of Liability</h2>
        <p>Notwithstanding any damages that you might incur, the entire liability of Dapplets Project and any of its
          suppliers
          under any provision of this Agreement and your exclusive remedy for all of the foregoing shall be limited to
          the
          amount actually paid by you for the website.
        </p>
        <p>To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, in no event shall Dapplets Project or its suppliers be
          liable
          for any special, incidental, indirect, or consequential damages whatsoever (including, but not limited to,
          damages
          for loss of profits, for loss of data or other information, for business interruption, for personal injury,

          fails of its essential purpose.
        </p>
        <p>Some states/jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so

        <h2>Severability</h2>

          any
          other term, and Dapplets Project's failure to assert any right or provision under this Agreement shall not
          constitute a waiver of such right or provision. YOU AND Dapplets Project AGREE THAT ANY CAUSE OF ACTION
          ARISING OUT
          OF OR RELATED TO THE SERVICES MUST COMMENCE WITHIN ONE (1) YEAR AFTER THE CAUSE OF ACTION ACCRUES. OTHERWISE,

          CAUSE OF ACTION IS PERMANENTLY BARRED.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h2>Waiver</h2>
        <p>Except as provided herein, the failure to exercise a right or to require performance of an obligation under
          this
          Agreement shall not effect a party's ability to exercise such right or require such performance at any time
          thereafter nor shall be the waiver of a breach constitute waiver of any subsequent breach.
        </p>
        <p>o failure to exercise, and no delay in exercising, on the part of either party, any right or any power under
          this
          Agreement shall operate as a waiver of that right or power. Nor shall any single or partial exercise of any
          right or
          power under this Agreement preclude further exercise of that or any other right granted herein. In the event
          of a
          conflict between this Agreement and any applicable purchase or other terms, the terms of this Agreement shall
          govern.

          EQUITABLE RELIEF REGARDING THE ENFORCEMENT OR VALIDITY OF YOUR OR Dapplets Project's INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY

          In the event of a dispute, you or Dapplets Project must give the other a Notice of Dispute, which is a written
          statement that sets
          forth the name, address, and contact information of the party giving it, the facts giving rise to the dispute,
          and the relief
          requested. You must send any Notice of Dispute via email to: <a
            href="mailto:contact@dapplets.org">contact@dapplets.org</a>. Dapplets Project will send
          any Notice of
          Dispute to you by mail to your address if we have it, or otherwise to your email address. You and Dapplets
          Project will attempt to
          resolve any dispute through informal negotiation within sixty (60) days from the date the Notice of Dispute is
          sent. After sixty

          litigate (or participate in

          accordance with the commercial arbitration rules of the American Arbitration Association. Either party may
          seek any interim or
          preliminary injunctive relief from any court of competent jurisdiction, as necessary to protect the party’s
          rights or property
          pending the completion of arbitration. Any and all legal, accounting, and other costs, fees, and expenses
          incurred by the
          prevailing party shall be borne by the non-prevailing party.
