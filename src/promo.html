            <p>
              In the internet business, as we know it now, only website owners
              can create and earn money from business processes that run on
              their websites. This is because ownership means full control over
              the users' communications.
            </p>
            <p>
              Dapplets Project disrupts this paradigm and creates technology
              that enables new kinds of applications - dapplets. These dapplets
              run on top of existing websites, in the websites' context, but out
              of the website owners' control. This new paradigm enables tons of
              brand new applications and business opportunities.
            </p>
            <p>
              Dapplets technology also has a big social impact: it allows
              censorship-resistant user flows on centrally owned websites, even
              for banned content and banned users. It cancels the “cancel
              culture“ effectively.
            </p>
            <p>
              Dapplets is a true Web3 project: unstoppable, permissionless,
              anonymous, open-source, and decentralized, not only on the backend
              level but on the UX level too.
